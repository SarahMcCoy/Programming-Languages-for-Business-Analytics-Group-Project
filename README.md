# Programming-Languages-for-Business-Analytics-Group-Project

"Welcome to the BCIS 5110 Programming Languages for Business Analytics Group Project repository! This project encompasses the culmination of skills acquired in a Python-focused course tailored for business analytics. With a curriculum akin to a data science and machine learning boot camp, participants delved into Python programming for data analytics, covering a spectrum of concepts essential for extracting insights from datasets. This repository houses our final group project, showcasing the application of learned concepts in a comprehensive analysis of a retail store dataset sourced from Kaggle. From data exploration to implementation of conditional statements, loops, functions, and visualization techniques using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, our project embodies the essence of real-world data analysis scenarios. Dive in to explore our journey through Python programming for business analytics!"

## The Objective: 
In this assignment, you will work with a dataset consisting of at least 1000 rows and 15 columns, containing 5 to 10 percent missing values. The objective is to practice your Python coding skills while performing data analysis tasks on the given dataset. Formulate ten research questions based on the dataset. These questions should require data analysis and provide meaningful insights into the dataset. You will be working in groups, and each group is required to submit a Python code file that addresses the following topics:

### Data exploration:
Write code to display the shape of the dataset (number of rows and columns).
Identify and handle missing values using an appropriate imputation technique.
### Conditional statements:
Implement a code segment that utilizes conditional statements to filter, select, or transform data based on specific conditions.
### Loop implementation:
Write two code implementations that utilize loops to iterate over the dataset, performing a specific task or calculation. One of the implementations should include the use of the break or continue statement.
### Function definitions:
Define at least two functions that operate on the dataset. One of the functions should utilize keyword arguments for flexible parameter passing.
### Data visualization:
Implement at least one code segment that focuses on data visualization using a suitable library such as Matplotlib or Seaborn. Generate visualizations to represent patterns, trends, or relationships in the dataset.
### Numpy functions:
Include at least two code segments to demonstrate the use of Numpy functions for numerical calculations or manipulations on the dataset.
### Pandas functions:
Incorporate at least two code segments to showcase the use of Pandas functions for data manipulation, analysis, or aggregation on the dataset.
